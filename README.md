Lung CT Cancer Detection & Tumor Segmentation with U-Net and XAI

This project focuses on building a deep learning pipeline to detect lung cancer from CT scan images. It uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for classification and a **U-Net** model for precise tumor segmentation. Explainability is integrated using **Grad-CAM** and **SHAP**, allowing visual insights into model predictions for clinical trust.

 Project Objectives

- Classify CT scan images as **Benign**, **Malignant**, or **Normal**
- Perform **tumor segmentation** using U-Net
- Apply **Grad-CAM** for explainable AI (XAI)
- Generate visual diagnostic reports to support clinical decisions

---

 Models Used

- ‚úÖ **Vision Transformer** for multi-class classification (3 classes)
- ‚úÖ **U-Net** for segmentation of tumor regions
- ‚úÖ **Grad-CAM** for class activation heatmaps

 Dataset

> The dataset contains CT images labeled as:
- `Benign` (non-cancerous)
- `Malignant` (cancerous)
- `Normal` (healthy lungs)

**Format:** `.png` / `.jpg` grayscale CT images  
**Labels:** Stored in `labels.csv` with fields: `filename`, `label`

(*Note: For licensing reasons, dataset is not included in this repo. Please refer to publicly available lung CT datasets such as the [LUNA16 dataset](https://luna16.grand-challenge.org/), [NSCLC Radiogenomics](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/NSCLC+Radiogenomics), or others.*)

## üöÄ How It Works

### ü©∫ 1. Preprocessing
- Resized CT images to 224√ó224
- Normalized pixel values
- Applied data augmentation for generalization

### üß† 2. Classification (CNN)
- Trained a Vision Transformer (ViT) model on CT image data for 3-class classification.
- Applied a softmax output layer for multi-class prediction.
- Achieved improved feature representation by leveraging transformer-based attention mechanisms.
- Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

### üß¨ 3. Segmentation (U-Net)
- Trained U-Net model on binary lung/tumor masks
- Output: segmented binary masks highlighting tumor areas

### üîé 4. Explainability
- Applied **Grad-CAM** to CNN to generate activation heatmaps
- Combined outputs into downloadable diagnostic reports
